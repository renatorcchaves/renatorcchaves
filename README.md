# Hey, I'm Renato Chaves ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a data scientist learner, focusing in libraries like Pandas, Scikit-Learn and Matplotlib. 

I have a degree in mechanical engineering from college, with a postgraduate degree in lean manufacturing and a second postgraduate degree in leadership. During my career, I have worked as a production planner, process engineer, process and logistics coordinator, and production supervisor, among other roles.

During my professional career, I have always been fascinated by improving processes, helping other people to obtain better results or in an easier way.

Because I have an analytical mind, which has always made it easy for me to interpret and manage data, transforming it into important insights to solve problems in my work, I have been able to lead several projects related to cost reduction and improving operational efficiency during my career.

Now, I am becoming a professional in the area of â€‹â€‹data science so that I can lead more complex projects.
